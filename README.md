# Diamond-Price-Prediction
The "Diamond Price Prediction" project aims to forecast the prices of diamonds utilizing their inherent characteristics. This analysis leverages the Diamonds dataset available on Kaggle, which encompasses 53,940 observations and encompasses 10 variables.

The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict diamond prices based on these variables, enabling insights into the relationships between diamond attributes and their market values. Through data-driven analysis, this project seeks to enhance our understanding of diamond pricing trends and provide valuable predictive insights for the diamond industry.

Comprising an extensive 53,940 observations and featuring 10 essential variables, this dataset captures a comprehensive spectrum of diamond traits, including carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and more.
To realize the project's ambition, it employs advanced machine learning regressors, specifically the Random Forest Regressor and the Decision Tree Regressor. These sophisticated algorithms are engineered to decipher intricate patterns and relationships within the data, enabling them to provide insightful predictions with remarkable accuracy.
